# WeLoveMovies
We Love Movies was a Capstone Project for Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp.  It required me to use Express, PostgreSQL, Knex, RESTful design principles, etc.

We Love Movies is a website that let's users see which movies are playing in the city of Portland.  It is an example of my ability to access and navigate databases to display information in a client facing web application.
